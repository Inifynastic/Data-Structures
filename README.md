This is my custom Data Structures.

My Rules for working on this project:-
- STL Data Structures are not allowed.(Excluding streams and exceptions)
- I am building them without looking at the standard methods.(SO ITS GONNA BE A MASSIVE CHAOS!)
- I am now allowed to use Smart Pointers. Everything must be done manually.
- Abstraction = Bad(Unless I made it myself)
- I must always implement the Rule of 5 as long as it is possible.

Current Progression:-

Easy:

- ✅ Dynamic Array (Completed) #1
- ✅ Stack (Completed) [I might have just build it over Dynamic Array!] #3 
- ✅ Queue(Completed but needs a better algorythm) [I might have just build it over Dynamic Array!] #5
- ✅ Circular Buffer (Completed) #4


Intermediate:

- Linked List[Half Done]
  - ✅ Singly Linked List(Completed) #2
  - Doubly LinkedList [Next on the list!!]
- Deque
- Heap
- Priority Queue
- Union-Find


Pain in the ass:

- Hash Map 
- Advanced Hash collision strategies 
- ✅ Binary Tree(Competed)[This is a advanced complete binary tree which I accidentally made.] #6
- ✅ BST(Binary Search Tree)(Completed) [This was easy because of old BT] #7
- Graphs
- Trie


REALLY pain in the ass (Advanced stuff):

- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- B-Trees
- Skip List
- Bloom Filter
