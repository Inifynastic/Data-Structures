This is my custom Data Structures.

My Rules for working on this project:-
- STL Data Structures are not allowed.(Excluding streams and exceptions)
- I am building them without looking at the standard methods.(SO ITS GONNA BE A MASSIVE CHAOS!)
- I am now allowed to use Smart Pointers. Everything must be done manually.
- Abstraction = Bad(Unless I made it myself)
- I must always implement the Rule of 5 as long as it is possible.

Current Progression:-

Easy:

- ✅Dynamic Array (Completed)
- ✅Stack (Completed)
- ✅Queue(Completed but needs a better algorythm)
- ✅Circular Buffer (Completed)


Intermediate:

- Linked List[Half Done]
  - ✅ Singly Linked List(Completed)
  - Doubly LinkedList[TBA]
- Deque
- Heap
- Priority Queue
- Union-Find


Pain in the ass:

- Hash Map 
- Advanced Hash collision strategies 
- Binary Tree
- BST(Binary Search Tree)
- Graphs
- Trie


REALLY pain in the ass (Advanced stuff):

- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- B-Trees
- Skip List
- Bloom Filter
